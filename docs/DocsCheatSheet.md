Use case
Conversation between an actor external to the system and the system to obtain an observable result of interest.

Context diagram
Diagram where we see the states of the system and how we transition from one to another via use cases.

System state
The system state is, given certain data, what the system can or can't do with the given data.

Maintenance types

- Perfective (adds or modifies functionality)
- Corrective (fixes functionality)
- Adaptive (manage compatibility, often solved via versioning)

RUP says
One view per actor and one controller for each use case.
Models come out from the domain model diagram.
If diagrams have been done properly this will be enough to inspire the 80% of the software.
